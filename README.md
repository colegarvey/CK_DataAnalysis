# Data Analysis: Costco vs. Kroger

The following is a data science project where I take some data and try to solve the question,  where is best place for someone to get these healthy foods?  

There could be many valid answers to this question, however I will be analyzing two large food retailers such as Costco and Kroger.  Due to their rather large size and audience I thought that they are similarly equipped and comparable.  

Note: The conclusions drawn in the analysis is based off specific data and my own assumptions.  The data is not generalized to all food grades, we only look at some of the healthiest graded foods from both retailers.  There are some statements throughout the analysis that are factual but the general assumptions and conclusions are based on a specific grouping of data and is not sound.
